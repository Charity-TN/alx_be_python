# Calculate the simple interest using the following variables
principal = 1000 # (representing $1000)
rate = 0.05      # (representing 5% annual interest rate)
time = 3         #time (representing 3 years)

# Calculate the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

#Print the results
print(f"The simple interest is : {interest}")
